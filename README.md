# Automated Epistemology Engine (AEE) - Era Version

## 🔍 Model Description

**The Automated Epistemology Engine (AEE) Era** is a groundbreaking, first-of-its-kind epistemological processing system designed to revolutionize how we extract, evaluate, and integrate information from diverse textual sources. **As the only comprehensive epistemically-aware information system currently available**, AEE Era represents a significant advancement in automated reasoning and knowledge management.

The system constructs a sophisticated knowledge base by extracting propositional structures, determining their reliability through multiple assessment layers, detecting various forms of bias, and establishing nuanced relationships between different pieces of information—all while maintaining full epistemic transparency.

### 🌟 Key Features

- **🧠 Epistemically Aware Information Extraction**: Extracts subject-relation-value propositions from text with confidence scores calibrated to linguistic modality markers (e.g., "definitely," "might," "perhaps")
  
- **⚖️ Plausibility Assessment**: Evaluates how reasonable propositions are based on built-in validation heuristics and world knowledge patterns
  
- **🔗 Comprehensive Relation Detection**: Identifies not only direct contradictions but also conceptual opposites, synonym-based support, and relational conflicts
  
- **📊 Multi-factor Source Reliability Calculation**: Dynamically assesses the reliability of information sources based on contradiction patterns and consistency
  
- **🚩 Advanced Bias Detection**: Flags potential biases including source monoculture (lack of source diversity), unbalanced arguments, and citation circles
  
- **⭕ Circular Reasoning Detection**: Identifies and penalizes circular support patterns in the knowledge base
  
- **📈 Sophisticated Confidence Scoring**: Calculates dynamic confidence scores using an integrated model that accounts for source reliability, plausibility, linguistic certainty, supporting evidence, contradicting evidence, and bias penalties
  
- **📝 Human-readable Explanations**: Generates clear, detailed explanations of the epistemological status of each proposition in the knowledge base

## 🚀 Why AEE Era is Revolutionary

As the **first and only system of its kind**, AEE Era stands alone in offering:

1. **Complete Epistemological Awareness**: Unlike traditional NLP systems that focus only on extraction, AEE Era maintains epistemic metadata throughout the processing pipeline
   
2. **Multi-dimensional Assessment**: Evaluates information across dimensions of source reliability, linguistic confidence, plausibility, and network effects
   
3. **Transparent Reasoning**: Every confidence score can be traced back to its contributing factors and explained in human-readable terms
   
4. **Bias-Aware Processing**: Actively identifies and mitigates multiple forms of bias that affect knowledge reliability
   
5. **Integration of Contradictory Information**: Rather than discarding contradictions, incorporates them into a coherent knowledge framework with appropriate confidence adjustments

## 💡 Intended Uses

AEE Era is designed for applications requiring sophisticated epistemological assessment of information:

- **🔍 Advanced Fact-Checking Systems**: Assess reliability of claims across multiple sources with nuanced confidence scoring
  
- **🔄 Intelligent Information Integration**: Combine information from diverse sources with appropriate confidence weighting and contradiction resolution
  
- **📚 Research Analysis Tools**: Analyze the epistemological structure of complex arguments and research literature
  
- **⭐ Source Credibility Assessment**: Evaluate the reliability of different information sources based on their consistency and agreement patterns
  
- **👁️ Bias Detection and Mitigation**: Identify potential biases in knowledge bases, citation networks, or information ecosystems
  
- **❓ Uncertainty-Aware Knowledge Bases**: Build knowledge bases that explicitly represent certainty levels and evidential relationships

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

The AEE Era system consists of these elegantly designed components:

1. **🧩 Core Classes**: Sophisticated data structures (Proposition and EpistemicData) that maintain rich epistemological metadata
   
2. **🔍 Extractor**: Leverages SpaCy for linguistic analysis to extract propositions from text with modality-aware confidence calibration
   
3. **✅ Validator**: Assesses the plausibility of propositions using multiple knowledge-based heuristics
   
4. **🔗 Linker**: Establishes support/contradiction relationships between propositions using semantic understanding of opposites, synonyms, and relations
   
5. **⚠️ Bias Detector**: Identifies potential biases including source monoculture, argument imbalance, and citation circles
   
6. **🔄 Updater**: Intelligently updates confidence and reliability scores based on a sophisticated multi-factor model
   
7. **📋 Explainer**: Generates detailed, human-readable explanations of proposition status and confidence

## 📥 Inputs and Outputs

### Inputs:
- Text documents with source identifiers
- Optional source type information

### Outputs:
- A structured knowledge base of propositions with:
  - Extracted structural representation (subject-relation-value)
  - Comprehensive epistemological metadata (confidence, reliability, plausibility)
  - Rich inter-proposition relationship network (support/contradiction links)
  - Bias and quality flags
  - Detailed human-readable explanations for each proposition

## 📊 Performance Highlights

AEE Era has demonstrated exceptional capabilities in:

- **Linguistic Modality Recognition**: Accurately calibrates initial confidence based on certainty expressions
- **Contradiction Detection**: Successfully identifies both direct and semantic contradictions
- **Bias Identification**: Effectively flags sources with systematic issues and circular reasoning patterns
- **Confidence Refinement**: Produces well-calibrated final confidence scores that reflect multiple evidence factors

## 💻 Example Usage

```python
from aee_era_main import run_aee_era_pipeline

# Define input texts with source information
inputs = [
    {
        "source_id": "research_paper.edu",
        "source_type": "scientific_paper",
        "text": "Studies demonstrate that regular exercise significantly reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease."
    },
    {
        "source_id": "health_blog.com",
        "source_type": "blog",
        "text": "Exercise might help with heart health, but the benefits could be overstated in some research."
    }
]

# Run the pipeline
knowledge_base = run_aee_era_pipeline(inputs)

# Print the resulting knowledge base and explanations
for prop_id, prop in knowledge_base.items():
    print(f"Proposition: {prop.text_span}")
    print(f"Subject-Relation-Value: {prop.subject_lemma}-{prop.relation_lemma}-{prop.value_lemma}")
    print(f"Initial Confidence: {prop.epistemic_data.initial_confidence}")
    print(f"Final Confidence: {prop.epistemic_data.computed_confidence}")
    print(f"Plausibility: {prop.epistemic_data.plausibility_score}")
    print(f"Bias Flags: {prop.epistemic_data.bias_flags}")
    print("---")
```

## 🔧 Customization Options

AEE Era can be customized in several ways:

- **Plausibility Knowledge**: Extend the validator with domain-specific plausibility rules
- **Synonym and Opposite Dictionaries**: Expand the built-in dictionaries for better relation detection
- **Confidence Parameters**: Adjust the weights of different factors in confidence calculation
